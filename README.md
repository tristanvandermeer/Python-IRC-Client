# Python-IRC-Client
A WIP IRC Client built in Python with the Socket library.

# Sunday October 6th Update

It works! 

...mostly. Just need to optimise some of the command searching, and for some reason the PART command doesn't work. I need to look into the documentation for the IRC protocol for leaving and joining channels.

Then I will probably add things that make it a little more user friendly. Right now its just a proof of concept :)

# Previous Readme

At this moment, all it does is connect to Freenode IRC server and exchange PING/PONG messages.

I will be adding channel joining and message sending functionality later.

Later.
